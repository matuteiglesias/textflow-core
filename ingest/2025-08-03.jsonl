Your `yarn` version is `0.32+git`, which is **not Yarn Classic (v1.x)** nor **Yarn 2+** ‚Äî it's the Debian package manager‚Äôs forked version, and it's missing expected behaviors and dependencies.\n\n2. Your project likely expects **Yarn v1.x or Yarn v3+**, where `lint-staged` would be installed locally under `node_modules\/.bin\/`.\n\n3. `husky` is likely set up in `.husky\/` to run `lint-staged` in the commit hook. Since `lint-staged` is not found, the commit fails.\n\n---\n\n### üß∞ Options to Fix It\n\n#### üîß Option 1: Install lint-staged properly\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev lint-staged\n```\n\nThen try again:\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Update\"\n```\n\nThis assumes your project uses Yarn correctly (which it might not if you're on the broken Debian yarn version).\n\n---\n\n#### üßº Option 2: Bypass the hook temporarily\n\nIf you trust your changes and just want to commit anyway:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Update\" --no-verify\n```\n\nThis skips `lint-staged` and all pre-commit hooks.\n\nUse this cautiously. It won‚Äôt fix the root problem ‚Äî it just lets you move forward now.\n\n---\n\n#### üßº Option 3: Remove or fix the hook\n\nOpen `.husky\/pre-commit` and either:\n\n- Comment out or remove the `npx lint-staged` line\n- Or edit it to explicitly call a valid script\n\nIf you‚Äôre not using `husky`, check `.git\/hooks\/pre-commit` instead.\n\n---\n\n### üîÑ Long-Term Fix\n\nYou should install a proper version of Yarn ‚Äî ideally v1.22.x for most Docusaurus v2 setups:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g yarn\nyarn --version  # should now be ~1.22\n```\n\nThen re-run:\n\n```bash\nyarn install\n```\n\nThat should restore proper `node_modules\/.bin\/lint-staged` behavior and stop the errors.\n\n---\n\nLet me know which path you prefer ‚Äî I‚Äôd recommend **Option 1** for correctness or **Option 2** for speed."}
