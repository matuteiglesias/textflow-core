The `00h00m00s 0\/0:` timestamp format suggests that some custom wrapper or script is intercepting the command.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Let's dissect this.\n\n#### 1. **Is `yarn` being wrapped by something else?**\n\nRun this to inspect what's actually being called:\n```bash\nwhich yarn\ntype yarn\n```\n\nAlso, try:\n```bash\nyarn --version\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Try running Docusaurus directly**\n\nLet’s bypass any wrapper and run the underlying Docusaurus command:\n\n```bash\nnpx docusaurus build\n```\n\nIf that works, it confirms the issue is with your yarn environment or scripts.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Inspect `package.json` scripts**\n\nCheck if there's a custom `build` script in `package.json` that might be malformed:\n\n```bash\ncat package.json | grep '\"build\"'\n```\n\nExpected output (for Docusaurus) is something like:\n\n```json\n\"build\": \"docusaurus build\"\n```\n\nIf instead you have something like:\n\n```json\n\"build\": \"python build\"  # ← wrong\n```\n\nor anything invoking a Python script, it would explain the `Errno 2` and Python-like error trace.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 Action Plan\n\nPlease follow these steps in order:\n\n1. Run:\n   ```bash\n   yarn --version\n   which yarn\n   type yarn\n   ```\n\n2. Show me the `build` line in your `package.json`:\n   ```bash\n   grep '\"build\"' package.json\n   ```\n\n3.

Your `yarn` version is `0.32+git`, which is **not Yarn Classic (v1.x)** nor **Yarn 2+** — it's the Debian package manager’s forked version, and it's missing expected behaviors and dependencies.\n\n2. Your project likely expects **Yarn v1.x or Yarn v3+**, where `lint-staged` would be installed locally under `node_modules\/.bin\/`.\n\n3. `husky` is likely set up in `.husky\/` to run `lint-staged` in the commit hook. Since `lint-staged` is not found, the commit fails.\n\n---\n\n### 🧰 Options to Fix It\n\n#### 🔧 Option 1: Install lint-staged properly\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev lint-staged\n```\n\nThen try again:\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Update\"\n```\n\nThis assumes your project uses Yarn correctly (which it might not if you're on the broken Debian yarn version).\n\n---\n\n#### 🧼 Option 2: Bypass the hook temporarily\n\nIf you trust your changes and just want to commit anyway:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Update\" --no-verify\n```\n\nThis skips `lint-staged` and all pre-commit hooks.\n\nUse this cautiously. It won’t fix the root problem — it just lets you move forward now.\n\n---\n\n#### 🧼 Option 3: Remove or fix the hook\n\nOpen `.husky\/pre-commit` and either:\n\n- Comment out or remove the `npx lint-staged` line\n- Or edit it to explicitly call a valid script\n\nIf you’re not using `husky`, check `.git\/hooks\/pre-commit` instead.\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Long-Term Fix\n\nYou should install a proper version of Yarn — ideally v1.22.x for most Docusaurus v2 setups:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g yarn\nyarn --version  # should now be ~1.22\n```\n\nThen re-run:\n\n```bash\nyarn install\n```\n\nThat should restore proper `node_modules\/.bin\/lint-staged` behavior and stop the errors.\n\n---\n\nLet me know which path you prefer — I’d recommend **Option 1** for correctness or **Option 2** for speed."}

It’s likely already installed if you're using the Debian `yarn`.\n\n#### 2. **Install the official Yarn (v1.x)**\n\n```bash\ncorepack enable\ncorepack prepare yarn@1.22.19 --activate\n```\n\nYou can verify:\n\n```bash\nyarn --version\n# Should output: 1.22.19\n```\n\n#### 3. **Now you can run:**\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev lint-staged\n```\n\nAnd your `git commit` should work.\n\n---\n\n### 🩹 Temporary Shortcut (if you’re blocked)\n\nTo commit right now without fixing the environment:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Update\" --no-verify\n```\n\nBut this won’t resolve future `yarn` issues, so it’s only for short-term use.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want to install **Yarn 3 (Berry)** instead — it's a different ecosystem with stricter rules, but might be useful long-term."}
