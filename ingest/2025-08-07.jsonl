Let’s map out, precisely and biologically, what happened during your **~42-hour clean phase** from Tuesday 6am to Wednesday night.\n\nWe’ll treat your prior state as a **polydrug comedown** involving:\n\n- **Alcohol (moderate-heavy, recent)**  \n- **Tobacco\/nicotine (moderate)**  \n- **Cannabis (moderate)**  \n- **Likely stimulant use (caffeine, maybe mild amphetamine analogs?)**  \n- **Sleep debt (moderate, from disrupted cycles)**  \n\n---\n\n## ⏳ **Phase Breakdown: Tuesday 6am to Wednesday Midnight (42h Clean)**\n\n### 🕓 **Hour 0–12 (Tuesday 6am–6pm)**\n**State**: Acute withdrawal, systemic rebound begins\n\n| System | Activity | Manifestation |\n|--------|----------|----------------|\n| **Liver** | Metabolizing remaining ethanol and acetaldehyde | You might have had fog, nausea, anxiety, or dry mouth — all part of the metabolic tail |\n| **Respiratory** | CO begins clearing, cilia wake | Throat itch, cough, or just more air hunger |\n| **Neurotransmitters** | Dopamine drops (no hits), GABA rebound slow | Restlessness, slight anxiety, craving surge |\n| **Autonomic system** | Sympathetic overactivity calming | Pulse may have dropped, BP started normalizing |\n| **Sleep pressure** | Accumulating due to late night | You were likely tired but overstimulated |\n\n> **Most common traps**: Seeking stimulation (TV, sugar, screens), confusing boredom with emptiness. Your brain still believed it's in “party mode” but is running out of fuel.\n\n---\n\n### 🕕 **Hour 12–24 (Tuesday 6pm–Wednesday 6am)**  \n**State**: Onset of biological restoration, fatigue wave hits\n\n| System | Activity | Manifestation |\n|--------|----------|----------------|\n| **CNS** | GABA, glutamate, and dopamine all down | You might’ve felt a \"low buzz\" or flatness, sleepiness without rest |\n| **Sleep system** | First opportunity for deep rebound | If you slept, your body used it heavily — even if it wasn’t restful |\n| **Inflammation** | Cytokines declining post-alcohol\/smoke | Sinuses may have opened slightly, throat may feel better |\n| **Mood** | Irritability or flat affect common | You’re still detoxing emotionally and neurochemically |\n\n> **Interpretation**: This is where **detox turns into healing** — if and only if you slept. A 6-hour nap here would’ve triggered some real **repair at the cellular level**, especially in your lungs and liver.\n\n---\n\n### 🕛 **Hour 24–42 (Wednesday morning to midnight)**\n**State**: First metabolic normalization plateau\n\n| System | Activity | Manifestation |\n|--------|----------|----------------|\n| **Lungs** | CO cleared, cilia re-engaged | You may have started to *feel* clearer air. |\n| **Dopamine** | Begins bottoming out → brain starts recalibrating | Boredom. Long stretches of not wanting anything. But also *clarity*, possibly |\n| **Sleep-wake rhythm** | Still desynchronized | Confusion around time, maybe naps or night awakenings |\n| **Liver** | Alcohol detox completed, insulin sensitivity improving | Hunger may have returned, but subtly |\n| **Cravings** | Shifted from biochemical to behavioral | You were probably pulled by habits more than actual physical need |\n\n> **Signals of progress**:  \n> - Urine gets lighter, body feels “cleaner”  \n> - You *think* more quietly, even if still a bit flat  \n> - The **pull to use** is less about relief, more about momentum or boredom\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Behavioral & Psychological Interpretation\n\nEven though only ~42h passed:\n- Your **respiratory and hepatic systems were past the detox phase**\n- Your **neurotransmitters were entering recalibration**\n- **Sleep debt** still dominated your recovery capacity — meaning even just a few hours of aligned circadian sleep would do more than supplements or food\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like, we can:\n- Create a **timeline log** of your body across the past 72 hours (including the substances you’ll list for Thursday)\n- Simulate and compare **what your metrics *would* have been** under continued use vs. what you’re getting in detox\n- Generate a **“biological journal”** that overlays physiological markers with behavior + events\n\nReady to reconstruct Thursday? Give me your inputs (substances, times, rough sleep), and I’ll annotate them physiologically."}

You're taking the right angle: **not shame, not regret — but system observation and cognitive control under load**. Let's break Thursday into its physiological consequences, then define your next 24h detox phase and give you tools to *observe* and *learn* rather than just \"endure\".\n\n---\n\n## 📆 Thursday Timeline: Substance Use + Sleep + Load\n\nLet’s map what your body faced from a systems biology standpoint.\n\n| Time  | Input | System Load | Expected Internal Effect |\n|-------|-------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| 00:00 | 450 ml wine | **Ethanol + sugar** | Sedative GABA spike → dopamine trickle → dehydration begins |\n| 01–03 | 0.5g weed | **CB1 stimulation** | Dopamine decoupling, mild sedation, sensory distortion |\n| 05:00 | 200 ml vodka + 200 ml Speed (likely caffeine\/taurine) | **Mixed-load**: CNS depressant + stimulant | Heart strain, sleep latency, liver overload begins |\n| ~06–10 | 4 hours “mils” sleep | **Very poor quality** | Sleep pressure unresolved, no REM rebound |\n| 15:00 | 100 ml whisky + 0.5g weed | **Rebound use** | Liver pushed again; CB1 re-suppressed; dopamine crash deferred |\n| 04–16:00 | <0.5g cocaine or analog | **Heavy CNS stimulant** | Dopamine\/norepinephrine flood, then depletion; possible microvascular strain |\n| 17:00 | Baseline begins | YOU ARE HERE → Start of detox clock |\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Key Physiological Impacts by 5–6 PM\n\n| System | Current State | Why It Matters |\n|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Liver** | Enzymatically overwhelmed; ethanol & stimulant byproducts processing | You'll feel weird mix of mental alertness + metabolic fog |\n| **Sleep system** | Circadian rhythm totally uncoupled; zero sleep architecture | No memory consolidation, no cellular repair happened |\n| **Neurotransmitters** | Dopamine flooded → now troughing; GABA down; glutamate possibly high | Irritability, craving, emotional volatility likely |\n| **Vascular system** | Likely mild vasoconstriction, higher HR | Possible headaches, cold hands\/feet, dizziness |\n| **Respiratory** | Likely baseline smoke irritation returning | Slight wheeze, throat dryness, decreased O₂ delivery |\n| **Cognitive control** | Depleted — you’ve been running on effortful override, not stable discipline | Now is the *true* start of control test — not earlier |\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 What Happens in the First 24h of Recovery (Post 6 PM Thursday)\n\n**This is your *T₀ moment* again.** Here’s what you can *expect to happen*, and how to use it.\n\n### 🔹 Hour 0–6 (6pm–midnight)\n- **Liver** begins catching up with unmetabolized substances  \n- **Heart rate** might stay elevated  \n- **You may feel wired but unstable**  \n- **Cravings will feel compelling, but they're decoupled from real need**\n\n> ✅ Strategy: Light mobility or walk, hot shower, **no food reward** — force the brain to **come down through decoupling**, not substitution.\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 Hour 6–12 (midnight–6am)\n- **Sleep latency may be awful** unless aided (e.g., melatonin, but carefully)\n- If you do sleep, expect:  \n  - Wild dreams  \n  - Wakeups  \n  - Possibly cold sweats (CNS readjusting)\n\n> ✅ Strategy: **Accept poor sleep** as detox symptom, not failure. Journaling cravings and tension *before bed* can offload mental load.\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 Hour 12–24 (6am–6pm Friday)\n- **First real drops in systemic load**\n- GABA rises  \n- Cilia engage  \n- You might feel:\n  - Foggy but a little calmer  \n  - Appetite coming back  \n  - Craving for “something fun” — that’s dopamine begging, not a real plan\n\n> ✅ Strategy: Gym session as you planned. Use tests to generate *scientific reward*, not hedonistic one. Replace dopamine spikes with **measurable accomplishment**.\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 Behavioral Frame: Self-Control as a Measurement\n\nYou said:\n> “If I had decent control, I should be able to hold it for 1 week straight.”\n\nLet’s formalize that:\n\n| Metric | Definition |\n|--------|------------|\n| **T₀** | Last substance use = Thurs 5–6pm |\n| **Checkpoints** | +6h, +12h, +24h, +48h, +72h, +96h, +120h, +144h, +168h |\n| **Scoring** | 1 point per clean checkpoint reached |\n| **Bonus Points** | 2x multiplier if gym session or journal entry is completed in prior 4h |\n\n> 🧠 This turns it into a *game of thresholds*, with **structured reflection as reinforcement**, not brute denial.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Generate a visual tracker of this recovery arc?\n2. Provide motivational text prompts or physiological markers per checkpoint?\n3. Create a PDF or Notion page for you to monitor?\n\nAlso — do you want support tools like a controlled **melatonin-sleep timing plan** or **food-as-recovery-support guidance**? Both can significantly improve early detox outcomes."}

Esta tesis tiene un encuadre potente y realista, especialmente si se la ancla a datasets concretos (como EPH + Censo) y se acota desde el inicio un dominio socioeconómico a analizar. Para preparar una **segunda reunión con uno de los estudiantes**, conviene ya tener una *ruta de arranque clara*, con decisiones tomadas sobre datos, objetivos parciales y herramientas.\n\nVamos a dividir esta planificación en:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Objetivo de la Segunda Reunión**\n- Asegurarte de que el\/la estudiante entienda el problema en profundidad.\n- Fijar los primeros pasos prácticos con entregables concretos.\n- Empezar a estrechar el foco del proyecto.\n- Introducir la dimensión de investigación académica: qué se está resolviendo, qué aportes nuevos se pueden hacer.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Temas para discutir en la segunda reunión**\n\n#### A. **Revisión del encuadre general**\n- ¿Qué significa “expandir” un censo con encuestas?\n- ¿Qué tipo de variables se pueden predecir? ¿Cuáles no?\n- ¿Qué ejemplos existen? (casos como el IPM de Oxford, o papers de small area estimation)\n\n#### B. **Definición del universo de datos concreto**\n- Presentar (o pedir que traiga) una breve descripción de:\n  - Dataset de encuesta elegido (EPH es el candidato obvio)\n  - Dataset de censo (Censo 2010, posiblemente REDATAM, si no está disponible 2022)\n  - Variables candidatas para emparejar (coincidentes)\n  - Variables candidatas para predecir (solo en EPH, no en censo)\n\n#### C. **Primer ejercicio propuesto**\n- Elegir una provincia o región piloto (ej. CABA o GBA)\n- Armar un dataset de entrenamiento: EPH → usar X para predecir Y\n- Armar un dataset de predicción: Censo → usar X\n- Empezar con modelos simples (RandomForest, XGBoost, no redes al principio)\n\n#### D. **Diseño del flujo de trabajo inicial**\n- Extracción + limpieza de EPH y Censo\n- Unificación de variables comunes\n- Análisis exploratorio: histogramas, correlaciones, visualización geográfica\n- Entrenamiento inicial\n- Evaluación de calidad del modelo y discusión de errores\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Primeros entregables concretos a pedir**\n- Cuaderno Jupyter con:\n  - Exploración y descripción de EPH\n  - Exploración y descripción del Censo\n  - Identificación de variables comunes + justificación\n  - Propuesta de 2–3 variables para predecir (con lógica socioeconómica)\n- Documento breve (1 página) con:\n  - Justificación del área geográfica elegida\n  - Supuestos y problemas detectados en los datos\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Dimensión investigativa (para ir sembrando)**\n- ¿Qué aporta este enfoque frente a estimaciones por promedios o imputaciones tradicionales?\n- ¿Cómo se evalúa la validez de la expansión?\n- ¿Qué limitaciones éticas o de diseño se presentan al inferir atributos individuales?\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Ideas para próximas reuniones o etapas**\n- Introducir estimadores robustos y métricas de equidad en el error de predicción.\n- Comparar resultados del modelo con otros indicadores disponibles (por ej. tasas de pobreza oficiales).\n- Explorar validación cruzada geográfica: entrenar en unas regiones, predecir en otras.\n- Generar visualizaciones espaciales de las predicciones.\n\n---\n\n¿Querés que te proponga también un esquema de presentación o slides para esa reunión? ¿O querés preparar un cuaderno base para que el estudiante trabaje sobre él?"}

There are three key dimensions to analyze: **(1) assessment timing and feasibility**, **(2) company positioning and risk**, and **(3) strategic value to your portfolio or job hunt**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Assessment Timing and Feasibility**\n\n### Facts:\n- You received the invite ~20 hours ago.\n- You have **~28 hours left** before the 48-hour window closes.\n- The assessment takes **up to 54 minutes**.\n- It requires **screen recording** and focused attention (no distractions).\n- You have other scheduled tasks and cannot accommodate an overnight cram.\n\n### Diagnosis:\n- You are **not late yet**, but you’re close to the limit. The situation is **salvageable** but requires prioritization.\n- If you cannot do it within the remaining time window, **you must accept that this application may lapse**, unless they have a way to re-open the assessment.\n\n### Strategy Options:\n- **Option A: Do the assessment within the window**, but **only if**:\n  - You can block off 60–90 minutes without jeopardizing higher-priority tasks.\n  - You are mentally fresh enough to perform well.\n\n- **Option B: Let it expire**, and if interest resurges, **re-engage later**, possibly requesting a reset of the test under reasonable justifications (e.g., scheduling conflicts, illness, etc.). These platforms often allow re-invites.\n\n- **Option C: Preemptively write to them**, stating that your availability didn’t align within the 48h window and that you’d appreciate the chance to reschedule. This might buy you more time **without ghosting**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Company Positioning and Risk (Proximity)**\n\n### Facts:\n- You've received **boilerplate messages** for multiple roles, implying scaled outreach and bulk testing.\n- They highlight their **AI Innovations Unit** and client metrics like \"370 million users.\"\n- Reports from community (e.g., Glassdoor, forums) suggest **exploitative or poor HR culture**.\n- They’re scaling, which implies **possible chaos or low-touch hiring** processes.\n\n### Diagnosis:\n- Likely a **VC-backed growth company** optimizing for volume and automation. They are fishing broadly.\n- The role might expose you to fast-paced AI projects—but also risks **burnout**, low pay, unclear expectations, or **being a disposable contractor**.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **Exploitative culture signals** shouldn’t be ignored unless:\n  - You’re desperate for a stepping stone.\n  - You want to take a short-term contract for income or exposure.\n\n- If you value mission fit, intellectual honesty, good management, or humane policies, this **may not align with your values**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Strategic Value to Your Portfolio or Trajectory**\n\n### Facts:\n- You’re building an **AI automation platform**, have experience with RAG systems, and want serious, high-leverage projects or research positions.\n- You're applying widely (World Bank, ZS, STC positions), including technical consulting and high-integrity roles.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- Ask: *What do I gain if I join Proximity?*\n  - Is it just money? Exposure to intense AI deployments? A name on the résumé?\n  - Is it worth disrupting your current strategic arc?\n\n- Their lack of personalization and potential reputation issues suggest this may **not help you** long-term **unless**:\n  - You specifically want **startup AI product exposure**.\n  - You’re testing **how far your skills can go in commercial AI delivery**.\n\n---\n\n## Final Recommendation\n\nIf you want to conserve energy and align with long-term gains, then:\n\n- **Default to skipping or requesting a postponement**.\n- Frame it as protecting your time and mental clarity for **higher ROI opportunities**.\n- If in doubt, write to them asking for a 48h extension due to scheduling conflicts. Gauge their response: it will tell you a lot about their flexibility and HR ethos.\n\nBut if you feel you could benefit from the learning or exposure—and can genuinely spare the hour—doing the assessment still fits within bounds. **Just don’t let urgency hijack strategy**.\n\nWould you like a short email draft to request postponement or test reset?"}

You mentioned you're at hour ~19 now — that gives you **~29 hours left**, not 12.\n\nThat’s a completely different situation: no need for panic or all-nighters.\n\n---\n\n## Revised Assessment of Your Situation:\n\n### ⏱ 1. **You’re Within Time**  \nYou have room to plan. If you block 1 hour either **tonight**, **tomorrow morning**, or even **early afternoon**, you’ll still meet the deadline.\n\n### 📌 2. **The Test is Low-Commitment**  \n- You lose nothing if you don't do it.\n- But if you do complete it, you gain potential entry to their next funnel stage (possibly a generic tech interview or trial task).\n\n### 🤔 3. **You Remain Strategically Ambivalent**  \nWhich is valid. It’s still unclear whether this opportunity deserves time and attention, *given the risk of low cultural fit, exploitative behavior, or low payoff.*\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Options Now (Prioritized)\n\n### ✅ **Option A — Rational Fit-Check** (best if ambivalent but curious)\n- Schedule the test **during a time you already planned for low-focus work**.\n- Take it seriously, but not obsessively.\n- Use the result as a **signal about what kind of applicants they’re selecting** and whether you care to continue.\n\n### 💤 **Option B — Let It Expire Silently** (best if it doesn’t excite you)\n- No harm done.\n- If they follow up, you can always say: \"I couldn't complete it within the timeframe; happy to retry if you’re still interested.\"\n\n### 📨 **Option C — Ask for a Reset Later** (best if it becomes attractive later)\n- Say you were engaged in other commitments and couldn’t complete the test, but would like to reschedule if there's still interest.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also help **evaluate the company’s specific AI projects or clients**, to see if any of it actually matches your ambition level. Would you like that? Or would you prefer a short email draft in case you skip the test and want to re-engage later?"}

Here's where clarity matters: most sources around this model actually reference **manual gearbox oil**, not automatic. Peugeot 207 HDi models from that period generally came with a 5-speed **manual transmission (BE4\/5)** rather than an automatic. Have you verified that your specific vehicle indeed has an **automatic transmission**?\n\n---\n\n###  What the sources say:\n- The maintenance guide cites an **automatic transmission fluid**, part number **9736 22**, capacity approx. **4.5 litres** citeturn0search0.\n- Conversely, forum discussions about the 1.6 HDi manual gearbox mention using **75W‑80**, filling **~1.9 litres** after draining citeturn0search7turn0search4.\n- The PSA spec for manual gear oils is **PSA B71 2330**, commonly met by **Total Transmission BV 75W‑80** or equivalent citeturn0search6turn0search10.\n\n---\n\n### If It’s an **Automatic Transmission**:\nYou’ll want fluid matching part number **9736 22**, which is the manufacturer-specified ATF. Unfortunately, I couldn’t locate a product listing for that exact fluid through the product search. You may wish to check Peugeot dealerships or specialist auto-parts shops for “Peugeot ATF 9736 22”.\n\n---\n\n### If It’s Actually a **Manual Gearbox** (most common for this model):\nYou’d need approximately **1.9 L of 75W‑80** gearbox oil meeting **PSA B71 2330** spec. Suitable options include:\n\nproducts{\"selections\":[[\"turn0product7\",\"Aceite De Caja Para Peugeot 207 Total 75W‑80\"],[\"turn0product6\",\"MANNOL Multivehicle JWS ATF (ATF III)\"]],\"tags\":[\"PSA‑approved 75W‑80 for Peugeot gearbox\",\"Generic ATF, but not PSA spec — less ideal\"]}\n\n- **product_entity[\"turn0product7\",\"Aceite De Caja Para Peugeot 207 Total 75W‑80\"]**: This is explicitly labelled for Peugeot 207, 75W-80—most aligned with the PSA recommendation.\n- **product_entity[\"turn0product6\",\"MANNOL Multivehicle JWS ATF (ATF III)\"]**: A generic automatic fluid; not meeting the PSA manual gearbox spec, and thus not advisable.\n\n---\n\n###  Recommendation Summary:\n- **First**, confirm whether your car actually has an **automatic** or **manual** transmission. That will determine the correct fluid type.\n- **If automatic**, seek ATF **9736 22** (roughly 4.5 L).\n- **If manual (most likely)**, use about **1.9 L of 75W‑80 gearbox oil**, meeting **PSA B71 2330**—like the Total Transmission BV product above.\n\nDo you have documentation or markings on the transmission that could clarify its type? Let’s make sure we’re aiming at the right target before locking in a purchase."}

For your **Peugeot 207, 1.6 HDi (diesel), 2010**, with **automatic transmission**, the **engine oil** specification is largely independent of the gearbox — so let's focus precisely on what matters:\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 Manufacturer Specification for Engine Oil\n\nPeugeot (PSA Group) recommends:\n\n- **ACEA C2**\n- **SAE 5W-30** (or 5W-40 if necessary, depending on temperature and driving conditions)\n- **Low-SAPS** (suitable for diesel particulate filter, DPF-equipped engines)\n\nThese engines are sensitive to oil quality due to their turbo and emissions systems. Using incorrect oil can lead to DPF clogging or turbo failure.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Top Recommended Oils\n\n**1. Total Quartz Ineo ECS 5W-30**\n- Fully synthetic, ACEA C2\n- PSA B71 2290 approved (PSA’s own spec for 1.6 HDi)\n- Formulated for fuel economy and DPF compatibility\n- **Recommended by Peugeot themselves**\n\n**2. Mobil Super 3000 FE 5W-30**\n- ACEA C2, low SAPS\n- Meets PSA B71 2290\n- Also a safe and tested option\n\n**3. Shell Helix Ultra Professional AR-L 5W-30**\n- Also meets ACEA C2\n- Very good thermal stability and DPF-safe\n\n---\n\n### 🔁 Capacity and Interval\n\n- **Oil capacity** (with filter): ~3.8–4.2 liters depending on exact engine code (DV6TED4, etc.)\n- **Oil change interval**: Every **10,000–15,000 km** or **once per year**, whichever comes first — but many owners opt for shorter intervals (10k or less) to protect the turbo and DPF\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Avoid\n\n- Any oil that does **not** meet ACEA C2 or PSA B71 2290\n- 10W-40 or semi-synthetics — too viscous and not suited for the HDi with DPF\n- ACEA C3-only oils — higher SAPS, not optimal for your DPF\n\n---\n\nWould you like help finding a local source or compatible substitute brands in Argentina?"}

Data Engineer (Mid–Senior Level)  \n**Por qué es “low-hanging fruit”:**  \n- **Stack muy cercano** al que ya tienes: Snowflake, DBT, Fivetran, Airflow, Python, SQL.  \n- Tu experiencia orquestando pipelines en Airflow\/DBT y modelando capas bronze\/silver\/gold encaja al 100%.  \n- Ya has documentado entregables BI\/ML en tu “Selected Projects” que hablan de Looker y métricas.  \n\n**Estrategia de éxito:**  \n- **Enfoca tu carta** en proyectos donde definiste “metric layer” y gobernanza de datos (por ej. tu “Spatial Diagnostics Toolkit” o tu “microdatos-EPH” adaptado a pipelines DBT).  \n- Menciona tu experiencia en procesos de “data observability” (alertas, logging) y rotación on-call, aunque sea conceptual.  \n- Al postular, resalta:  \n  - 5+ años en data engineering y dev Python.  \n  - Proyecto concreto con Snowflake + DBT + Airflow  \n  - Colaboración con BI (Looker) para “metric definitions”.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Solutions Engineer (Data Platform)  \n**Por qué conviene:**  \n- Más operativo\/DevOps, pero con mucho cruce a data: RBAC en Snowflake, Terraform, permisos, CI\/CD.  \n- Tu CV_DE lista explicitamente “Infrastructure as Code”, “Terraform” y “collaboration cross-teams”.  \n\n**Estrategia de éxito:**  \n- **Haz énfasis** en tu rol de “Advisor” en el Ministerio: gestionaste acceso, permisos, y middlewares documentados.  \n- Menciona:  \n  - experiencia con GitHub Actions y Terraform en despliegues de datos.  \n  - capacidad de “runbooks” y best practices de seguridad.  \n- Ofrece ejemplos abstractos de “operational runbooks” que produjiste (p.ej. runbook de microdatos).  \n\n---\n\n> **Por qué no los otros dos**  \n> - **Data\/Python Engineer**: requiere Spark\/streaming intensivo y claims health-care; tienes ML, pero no tanto “billion-row Spark jobs”.  \n> - **Data Modeler**: muy nicho en D365 Finance; no vienes del ecosistema ERP\/financiero, mejor no diversificar.  \n\n---\n\n**Envío único, CV_DE adaptado:**  \n- Mantén tu “Professional Experience” orientada a data pipelines y modelado.  \n- Ajusta el resumen para mencionar DBT\/Snowflake\/Terraform y tu pasión por la calidad de datos.  \n- En “Core Competencies” incluye explícitamente:  \n  - Data Modeling (Kimball), RBAC en Snowflake  \n  - Infraestructura: Terraform, GitHub Actions  \n  - Orquestación: DBT, Fivetran, Airflow  \n  - Python\/SQL avanzado  \n\nAsí, con **un solo CV alineado** a esos dos roles (y un breve “tailored cover note” que mencione ambos bullets), maximizas tus posibilidades en Forte Group sin parecer que mandas varios perfiles distintos.

I’ll bring that same rigor and attention to detail (no gremlins left behind) to your internal product library and client reports.\n\nI work comfortably in PST hours, thrive in distributed teams, and prioritize clear, empathetic communication. You need someone who owns projects from “what data do we have?” to “here’s your deliverable,” and I’m ready to step in, own the end-to-end process, and help IV.AI push your NLP capabilities even further.\n\nYou can review examples of my code and writing style on GitHub: github.com\/matuteiglesias. I’d love to discuss how I can contribute to IV.AI’s mission of making complex AI problems easy to solve.  \n\nLooking forward to connecting,  \nMatías Iglesias  \nmatuteiglesias@gmail.com | PST-based remote  "}

That makes it easy for a recruiter scanning 50+ resumes to see “this is the guy.”\n\n3. **Proof points via your journal**  \n   – Linking out to your live project log (the tag pages) gives you instant credibility—and shows you’re continuously active, not static. It’s a subtle but powerful differentiator.\n\n4. **Role-focused core competencies**  \n   – Each CV’s bullet-list of “Backend & APIs,” “Data Engineering,” “Full-Stack” skills now mirrors job jargon. You’re passing their keyword filters *and* making the human reviewer nod along.\n\n5. **Early signal from Proximity**  \n   – That swift “you’re a fit” email tells us the resume drilled the right target. They didn’t get hung up on generic data-science fluff, they saw you as an AI\/ML engineer from the first read.\n\n**Next steps:**  \n- Keep fine-tuning: after each positive response, note which bullet or phrasing likely triggered interest and reinforce it.  \n- Watch for patterns: if one CV keeps outperforming the others (e.g. your ML CV for AI\/ML roles), consider doubling down on its structure for similar jobs.  \n- Stay consistent: once a company shows interest, stick to the same CV flavor for all roles there—so your internal narrative stays coherent.\n\nBottom line: your CVs have gone from “one-size-fits-none” to “laser-focused match,” and that shift is already paying dividends."}

Senior AI Python Engineer (SDLC-focused AI tools)  \n**Use your Backend-Engineering (CV_2025_BE.pdf)**  \n- That CV emphasizes 7+ yrs building Python microservices, CI\/CD, Docker\/K8s, plus your newly added “RAG & agent” bullets.  \n- It positions you as someone who owns Python services end-to-end—just what they want for building AI-powered dev tooling (code generation assistants, CI integration, etc.).  \n\n**Pitch angle:** “I live at the intersection of backend and AI—shipping FastAPI microservices today and RAG-powered copilots tomorrow. I’m the person who’ll connect your LLM models into real CI\/CD pipelines and developer UIs.”  \n\n---\n\n## 3.

Good luck!"}

The same distributed-compute patterns apply in Spark: data partitioning, map-reduce transforms, caching intermediate results, etc.  \n\n2. **Table storage & optimization (Iceberg mindset)**  \n   - In my “microdatos-EPH-INDEC” project I designed a schema-versioned Parquet-on-S3 lake that supports time-travel queries and schema evolution. Apache Iceberg is the next logical step—its partition pruning and metadata layers follow exactly the principles I’ve already put in practice.  \n\n3. **SQL fluency**  \n   - I’ve written thousands of lines of complex SQL—window functions, CTEs, materialized views—to serve both survey-based poverty dashboards and geospatial conflict-region analyses. Optimizing joins and indexes to push down filters is second nature.  \n\n4. **Python \/ PySpark pipeline dev**  \n   - Every data pipeline I’ve authored—be it for small-area poverty nowcasts or Looker-driven BI suites—has been pure Python. Picking up PySpark’s RDD\/DataFrame APIs is just a matter of swapping imports; the functional-transform style is identical.  \n\n5. **Kubernetes & containers**  \n   - I containerize all my services with Docker (Flask\/FastAPI backends, Airflow schedulers, even MLflow experiments) and deploy them on GCP Cloud Run and Cloud Functions. Translating that into a Kubernetes manifest or Helm chart is a short sprint away.  \n\n6. **Data-warehouse & legacy-system integration**  \n   - I’ve harmonized cross-year household surveys with INDEC’s fixed schemas, built looker dashboards atop BigQuery, and automated end-to-end CI\/CD for data ingestion → cleaning → reporting. Migrations from flat files to managed tables? I’ve done the exact same for spreadsheets → Postgres → BigQuery.  \n\n7. **Cloud & on-prem migrations**  \n   - While my projects have lived mostly in the cloud, they’ve often had to integrate with on-prem police department SQL servers and legacy CSV exports. Reverse-engineering those formats, wrapping them in containerized extractors, and folding them into a modern data lake is a direct analogue to a true “migration” project.  \n\nAbove all, I’m a rapid learner and scientist by training—if there’s a new cluster, format or orchestration tool I haven’t used, I’ll own it until I can teach it by example. More important than having ticked every checkbox is that I understand the why behind every technology, and I know how to apply it to squeeze massive datasets into sub-second queries."}
